  <h1>Crucified with Christ Jesus</h1>
  <p>
    Galatians  2:20 I(Chibuogwu Jude Emmanuel 
    Onyemaechi) am crucified with Christ: 
    nevertheless I live; yet not I, 
    but Christ liveth in me: and the life which
     I now (16-05-2024) live in the flesh I 
     live by the faith of the Son of God, who 
     loved me, and gave himself for me.  
     2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: 
     for if righteousness come by the law, 
     then Christ is dead in vain.

  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
